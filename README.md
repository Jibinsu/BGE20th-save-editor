# BGE20th-save-editor
Save editor for BGE 20th anniversary

To Note: 
- not fully implemented reseralisation of information back into the save file yet 
- it will read the data, and display the headers and values, if you scroll down to the bottom, and then expand the last line, it will then allow you to view images in the right hand plane 
- DO NOT TRY AND USE THIS ON A SAVE YOU NEED!!! it will either not work or corrupt it if you try save the data back into the sav file, so use at your own disretion, this is just a jumping off point for people to build on.
